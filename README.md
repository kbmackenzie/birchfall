A little monadic parser combinator library for TypeScript and JavaScript, inspired by Haskell packages such as [parsec][2], [megaparsec][3] and [parser-combinators][4] and loosely based off of [this paper][1].

Birchfall is designed to be as close to its Haskell inspirations as it can, exporting pure functions and avoiding class-like abstractions (such as chained method calls).

It's a little personal library I made to learn more about parser combinators! It's meant for personal use, so I'm not adding any documentation, sorry! The code should be self-documenting enough for those who want to read it, however.
